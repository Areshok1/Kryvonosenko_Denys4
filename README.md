# Palindrome Checker

This repository contains a simple Java program that checks whether a given word is a palindrome. The project includes the main application, a test suite, and the palindrome-checking logic.

## Files

### 1) Main Application
- **File:** `Main.java`
- **Description:** This file contains the main application that prompts the user to enter a word, checks if it's a palindrome using the `PalindromeChecker` class, and displays the result.

### 2) Palindrome Checker Logic
- **File:** `PalindromeChecker.java`
- **Description:** This file provides the logic for checking whether a given word is a palindrome. The `isPalindrome` method removes spaces, converts the word to lowercase, and compares it with its reverse.

### 3) Test Suite
- **File:** `PalindromeCheckerTest.java`
- **Description:** This file includes a set of JUnit tests for the `isPalindrome` method in the `PalindromeChecker` class. It covers various scenarios, such as palindrome words and phrases, as well as non-palindromes.
